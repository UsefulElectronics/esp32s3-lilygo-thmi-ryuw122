In this tutorial, ESP32S3 microcontroller is used to interface RYUW122 UWB module from Reyax over UART with AT commands and a 2.8 Inch TFT display over I80 parallel interface and LVGL utilized for nicely looking user interface design.

In the used set up, 2 UWM module are used. One is configured as Acnchor and the other one is configured as Tag. the Anchor module reports communication distance when it received packet from the other end TAG device
